# Hungry Go Where
Hungry Go Where is a web application that recommends the nearest restaurant from wherever you are that also suits your tastes, based on your previous searches. It was built as part of a project submission for the NUS Summer Techfest 2023. 

In Hungry Go Where, you will automatically see a list of restaurants that are nearest to you based upon your location. If you are interested to search for restaurants serving a particular cuisine, you can simply use the search bar and type in a keyword and Hungry Go Where will show you the nearest restaurants to you matching this particular keyword. For example, if you type in the keyword 'Western', Hungry Go Where will show you a list of Western restaurants that are the closest to you. 

To try out Hungry Go Where now, go to https://hungry-go-where.vercel.app/

We are planning to add a new feature where Hungry Go Where will also display a list of relevant restaurants that you may be interested in based on your past searches. Stay tuned!
